# Digirule 2U by Brad Slattery and Brent Hauser

The Digirule 2U is basically an 8-bit programmable computer from the 1970's, built into a 20cm Ruler. You can program binary code directly into the Digirule 2U using the push buttons and LED's or you can write programs in assembly language on your computer then download them to the Digirule 2U via USB.

All files to make your own are included in this repository however you can also buy a pre-made version from my (https://www.google.com "Tindie Store.")
